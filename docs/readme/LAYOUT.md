# Banking Application Project Structure

This document outlines the recommended project structure for a mature banking application built with Go, detailing where specific components should reside within the project layout.

## Project Layout and Components

### `/cmd`
- **`/cmd/api`**
    - Contains the application's entry points, such as the main function for the web server. This structure supports multiple binaries by having a dedicated directory for each.

### `/internal`
- **`/internal/auth`**
    - Houses authentication logic, including Paseto token generation and OAuth2 integration. This is kept internal to restrict its use to this application only.
- **`/internal/user`**
    - Business logic related to user management. It encapsulates the core functionality away from external access.
- **`/internal/transaction`**
    - Core banking transaction processing logic. Kept internal to maintain privacy and separation from the API layer.

### `/pkg`
- **`/pkg/db`**
    - Database schema models and access utilities. Placed in `pkg` for potential reuse in different parts of the application or even externally.
- **`/pkg/utils` or `/pkg/helpers`**
    - General utilities and helper functions. These could be reused across various projects, hence placed in `pkg`.

### `/configs`
- **`/configs/config.go`**
    - Responsible for loading .env files and other configurations. Centralizing configuration settings makes them easily manageable.

### `/api`
- **`/api/swagger.yaml`**
    - API documentation in Swagger/OpenAPI format, enabling easy generation of client libraries and interactive documentation.

### `/scripts`
- **`/scripts/migrate.sh`**
    - Scripts for database migration. Allows for easy management of database changes from the command line.

### `/web` or `/ui`
- **`/web`**
    - Contains static assets and frontend code. This is relevant if the application includes a web interface.

### `/jobs`
- **`/jobs/scheduler.go`**
    - Definitions and scheduling for background jobs, such as batch processing. Organized separately for clarity.

### `/pkg/cache`
- **`/pkg/cache/redis.go`**
    - Redis integration for caching, placed in `pkg` to suggest that cache logic is abstracted and reusable.

### `/pkg/notification`
- **`/pkg/notification/email.go`**
    - Logic for sending emails. Since email functionality might be used across different contexts, it's placed in `pkg`.

### `/pkg/storage`
- **`/pkg/storage/s3.go`**
    - AWS S3 integration for file storage. Encapsulates file management logic for potential reuse.

## Additional Notes

- **Concurrency**: Go Routines and Channels are used throughout the application, especially in `/internal` modules, to handle concurrency effectively.
- **Middleware and Logging**: Defined in `/pkg/middleware` or `/internal/middleware` for request handling and `/pkg/logging` or `/internal/logging` for application logging, based on their reusability.
- **Deployment**: `Dockerfile` and Kubernetes configs are usually located in the project root or a `/deployments` directory, defining the deployment and runtime environment.

This structure promotes a clean separation of concerns, enhancing the maintainability and scalability of the application.
